>>>My code uses a for loop to run through all the rows in the csv file. It first adds a month for every row to get the total months value, and then it compares the current month to the previous month. If the current month is 0, that means the code is on row 1 and there is no previous month to compare to for the change value. If there is a previous month, it subtracts the previous month from the current month to find the value for change. To calculate total change, it continuosly adds change into total change while it loops through the rows. The average change is then calculated by dividing the total change by the total number of months. It then uses an if statement while looping through rows to decide if the change of the current row is larger or smaller than the current greatest increase or decrease, and updates the greatest increase and decrease values accordingly. All the calculations are then printed to the terminal and exported as a txt file.
